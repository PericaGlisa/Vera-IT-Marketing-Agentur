# Security Implementation for Contact Form

## Current Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ API key moved to `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- ✅ Email addresses configurable via environment variables
- ✅ Server-side validation of environment variables

### 2. Rate Limiting
- ✅ Maximum 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of rate limit records
- ⚠️ **Production Note**: Use Redis or database for distributed rate limiting

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Input length limits (max 1000 characters)
- ✅ HTML/script tag removal
- ✅ Minimum length requirements (name: 2 chars, message: 10 chars)

### 4. Security Headers & Logging
- ✅ IP address tracking in emails
- ✅ Timestamp logging
- ✅ Error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set these in your production environment
RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=info@verait.de
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@verait.de
```

### Additional Security Recommendations

1. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure your site uses HTTPS in production
2. **CORS Configuration**: Configure proper CORS headers
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement Redis-based rate limiting for production
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for failed requests and potential abuse
5. **Backup Email**: Configure backup email delivery method

### Rate Limiting Upgrade for Production

For production, replace the in-memory rate limiting with Redis:

```typescript
// Example Redis-based rate limiting
import Redis from 'ioredis'
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL)

async function checkRateLimit(ip: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const key = `rate_limit:${ip}`
  const current = await redis.incr(key)
  
  if (current === 1) {
    await redis.expire(key, 900) // 15 minutes
  }
  
  return current <= 5
}
```

## Security Features Summary

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| API Key Protection | ✅ | Stored in environment variables |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ | 5 requests per 15 minutes |
| Input Sanitization | ✅ | Removes dangerous characters |
| Email Validation | ✅ | Proper email format checking |
| Length Limits | ✅ | Prevents oversized inputs |
| IP Tracking | ✅ | Logs IP addresses for security |
| Error Handling | ✅ | No sensitive data exposure |
| Git Protection | ✅ | .env files ignored |

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor failed API requests
2. Track rate limit violations
3. Alert on unusual traffic patterns
4. Regular security audits of dependencies

**Note**: This implementation provides good basic security. For high-traffic production environments, consider additional measures like DDoS protection, advanced bot detection, and professional security auditing.
